# OPT Reconfig
Supplies much needed config files to keep OPT Spaceplane Parts useful and alive in the absence of the original modder, **K.Yeon**.
This modlet affects both OPT Main pack and OPT Legacy so be sure to always have this.
### Do not use this with OPT_USI, OPT_WBI, or OPT Legacy v1.0.9 or lower

* Adds a higher tech tree node than *Experimental Aircraft Engines* for the most OP of engines
* Makes all main pack engines less OP or more challenging to use
* Makes the weaker engines stronger at reasonable cost
* Replaces dirty old Firespitter configs with B9 Part Switch and Wild Blue Tools (WBI) (much easier to add the tank types you want to all parts in OPT Main and Legacy)
* Integrates USI Life Support, TAC and Snacks! through B9 or Wild Blue (absorbs the OPT_USI and OPT_WBI mods)
* Integrates Kerbalism through its own mechanisms and B9 Part Switch
* Delivers the fabled OPT FAR parch at last
* Gives gimbal and proper thrust and Isp (more of each) to the linear aerospike (makes it actually usable)
