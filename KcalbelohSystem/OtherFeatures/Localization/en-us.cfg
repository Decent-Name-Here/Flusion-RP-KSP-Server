        // For the information of translators, all the celestial bodies are named under the following rules:
        // 1. All the names are spelled backward. 
        //      - Some of them are from words in English, Latin, Italian, etc. 
        //      - Some of them are from Greek mythology. For example, Sera -> Ares.
        // 2. The names of all the planets from the same star system, and the names of all moons of the same planet, begin with the same letter. For example, the name of all the planet of Sunorc system begin with S, and the name of all the moons of Anehta begins with E.

        // Planet descriptions
        #LOC_KS_Aciore_description = Anehta is a gas giant planet with a Planetary ring. It is perpetually covered with clouds, which are subdivided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause violent storms and turbulence.
        #LOC_KS_Ahtpan_description = Ahtpan is a desert rocky planet with oceans mainly consists of naphtha. It looks like a good idea to build a petrochemical plant on its surface. KSC reminds all kerbonaut not to remove their helmets on its surface because the atmosphere is full of the smell of mothballs!
        #LOC_KS_Anneheg_description = Anneheg is a dark-colored planet like a big burning coal ball. It is so close to Aralc-A that its surface is melted by the strong light, forming lava rivers and oceans. Storms consisting of metal steam are happening every day on this planet. It must be one of the most hellish planets discovered.
        #LOC_KS_AralcA_description = Aralc-A, the first star of the binary system, is the brightest star in Kcalbeloh system. Its high temperature, along with the blue white color, suggests that Aralc-A is an A-type main-sequence star. 
        #LOC_KS_AralcB_description = Aralc-B, the second star of the binary system, is a small, low-mass star. It is an M-type main sequence star, known as red dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_AralcSystem_description = This is the barycenter of the binary star system.
        #LOC_KS_Arorua_description = Arorua is a large rocky planet tidally locked by Aralc-B. Due to the strong solar wind from Aralc-B, aurora can be observed from the entire hemisphere facing Aralc-B. At the same time, its atmosphere is gradually blowing away by the solar wind from the red dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_Dipuc_description = Dipuc is the only moon of Sera. Its surface is covered with large craters, indicating it has withstood many severe meteorite impacts for Sera. It is geologically active, with a large number of active volcanoes on its surface, as well as huge mountains that is even visavle near Sera. 
        #LOC_KS_Efil_description = When looking from a distance, Efil looks like a sapphire set near Anehta. The charming colors of the atmosphere and the beautiful beaches suggest it is a great place to vacation. Maybe in the future KSC will build a resort there but the problem is no one knows who will be able to afford the ticket to fly there.
        #LOC_KS_Elad_description = Elad is the largest moon of Anehta, and is also the first moon of Anehta discovered. It seems to have had an atmosphere in the past and even had liquid water on the surface, but it is a mystery why it lost them later.
        #LOC_KS_Enots_description = Enots is a tiny moonlet embedded in the ring of Anehta. It is the smallest moon of Anehta discovered up to now.
        #LOC_KS_Eulb_description = Eulb is … a blue moon.
        #LOC_KS_Iomena_description = Iomena is a rocky planet with large craters and oceans. Studies showed that the possibility of life existing here are slim beacause a high concentration of ammonia was detected in its atmosphere and oceans, but scientists haven't given up on finding life in such extreme environments.
        #LOC_KS_Kcalbeloh_description = Kcalbeloh is a super massive black hole, and also the center of Kcalbeloh system. It doesn't have a jet or a superheated blue accretion disk, indicating it has probably not devoured a star in millions of years.
        #LOC_KS_Maelg_description = Maelg is the coolest star in Kcalbeloh system, emitting far less light than other stars. It is classified as L-type brown dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_Mehtna_description = Mehtna is a cold planet tidally locked by Maelg. Most of its surface is covered by thick ice caps except the region near the sub-stellar point, which we call it "Warm Pole". Due to the low atmosphere pressure, the boiling point of water is even lower than room temperature. So water exists mainly in the form of ice or vapor on this planet and there is almost no liquid water.
        #LOC_KS_Meiuqer_description = Meiuqer is a tiny planet with a large eccentricity orbit. Its surface temperature changes dramatically with distance from Maelg.
        #LOC_KS_Noi_description = Noi is a small moonlet of Simeht. Scientists believe it might be one of the fragments from the great collision on Noira, because its composition is similar to the rocks near Noira’s giant crater.
        #LOC_KS_Noira_description = Noira is the only moon orbiting around Simetra, and is the only moon in Kcalbeloh System with a retrograde orbit. A giant crater can be observed on its surface, indicating that it has experienced a great collision with a relatively large celestial body. 
        #LOC_KS_Norihc_description = Norihc is a cold icy moon orbiting around the barycenter of the two gas giants. It’s geologically active, resulting in many deep cracks on the thick ice caps.
        #LOC_KS_Noyreg_description = Noyreg is a rocky moon with a very dense atmosphere. Its surface is almost completely obscured by thick cloud layers. Although the green-colored atmosphere looks fascinating, landing on the surface of Noyreg is considered extremely dangerous because of the high concentrations of chlorine in the air.
        #LOC_KS_Onrefni_description = Onrefni is a dwarf planet very close to Kcalbeloh. It is the closest celestial object to Kcalbeloh that has been discovered. Its surface is torn apart by extremely strong tidal forces.
        #LOC_KS_Rouqea_description = Rouqea is an ocean world, which means its surface is completely covered by water. Although it looks similar to Laythe, the ocean on Rouqea is totally different from Laythe's ocean. The ocean on Rouqea could be so deep that the immense pressures in the lower regions of the ocean could lead to the formation of a mantle of exotic form of ice.
        #LOC_KS_Sedah_description = Sedah is a hot gas-giant planet very close to Sunorc. Due to the high temperature of the atmosphere, it is glowing slightly. It is roughly the size of Jool but the mass is around eight times smaller, making its atmosphere fluffy.
        #LOC_KS_Sera_description = Sera is a desert rocky planet with a beautiful ring and several giant lakes. However, the lakes are toxic and there is no evidence of life on Sera.
        #LOC_KS_Simeht_description = Simeht is the smaller planet in the binary gas giant system. It is also classified as ice giants like Simetra, but its cloud bands and storms are relatively hard to be observed in visible light.
        #LOC_KS_SimeSystem_description = This is the barycenter of the binary gas-giant system.
        #LOC_KS_Simetra_description = Simetra is the bigger ice giant in Simetra-Simeht binary gas giant system. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance, though some unknown components are believed to color Simetra green and yellow color in some regions.
        #LOC_KS_Suluco_description = Suluco is a Kerbin-like planet tidally locked by Sunorc. It is a bifurcated world: on one side it's an endless day; on the other, eternal night. The boundary in between features a thin ring of twilit eternity, which is the only region that could support life.
        #LOC_KS_Sunorc_description = Sunorc is a K-type main sequence star, also known as orange dwarf. It is similar to Kerbol but smaller and cooler. This star is of particular interest in the search of extraterristrial life, because it tends to have a long lifespan and emits less UV radiation.
        #LOC_KS_Tot_description = An asteroid orbiting around Suluco.
        #LOC_KS_Uleg_description = Uleg is a cold icy planet orbiting further around Kcalbeloh. Its surface is almost completely covered by ice. The large inclination and eccentricity indicate that Uleg was probably captured by Kcalbeloh.
