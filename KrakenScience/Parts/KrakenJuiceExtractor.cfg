	description = A small Extractor, this drill is designed to help extract Kraken Juice from the crust of Bop. When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency. These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating. Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.
